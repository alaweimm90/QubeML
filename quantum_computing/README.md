# Quantum Computing Modules

Educational tutorials covering fundamental quantum computing tools and their applications to materials science.

## Modules

### Qiskit - Quantum Chemistry and VQE
- **qiskit_fundamentals.ipynb**: Introduction to quantum circuits, entanglement, and VQE
- Covers: Hello Qubit → Bell States → VQE → H₂ molecule simulation
- Connects quantum algorithms to electronic structure theory

### Cirq - Quantum Circuits and Spin Qubits  
- **cirq_fundamentals.ipynb**: Circuit design and noise modeling

- Variational circuits and hybrid optimization
- Applications to materials property prediction

## Learning Path

Start with Qiskit fundamentals to build intuition for quantum states and algorithms, then explore Cirq for circuit-level understanding, and finally PennyLane for quantum ML applications.

Each module includes:
- Theory explanations with mathematical foundations
- Working code examples
- Connections to materials science research
- Progressive complexity from basic to research-level concepts
