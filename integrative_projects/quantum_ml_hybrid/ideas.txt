Hybrid Quantum-ML Project Ideas
==============================

1. VQE + Classical Post-processing
   - Use VQE to find ground state energies
   - Apply classical ML to predict properties from energies
   - Status: Just an idea, need to research implementation

2. Quantum Feature Maps for Materials
   - Encode crystal descriptors into quantum circuits
   - Use quantum kernel methods for classification
   - Challenge: How to handle high-dimensional descriptor space?

3. Variational Quantum Regression
   - Train quantum circuits to predict bandgaps
   - Compare with classical neural networks
   - TODO: Check if this is even feasible with current hardware

Research Questions:
- What advantage do quantum methods provide for materials?
- How to handle noise in quantum predictions?
- Scaling to realistic problem sizes?
